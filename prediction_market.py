        Move a real-world postponed/cancelled/abandoned fixture to the refund
        path — PERMISSIONLESSLY and only when the sources CONFIRM it.

        This is deliberately NOT an admin power. There is no privileged key in
        this contract: just as anyone can call resolve() to settle a finished
        match, anyone can call mark_postponed() to open refunds for a match that
        was called off. What makes it safe is that it cannot be asserted — it
        must be *verified* against the same public sources, under the same
        validator consensus, as a result is.

        Constraints (all enforced on-chain):
        1. Only while status is OPEN — it can never unwind a settled market.
        2. Only after kickoff + POSTPONE_GRACE_SECS — a postponement cannot be
           declared before or during the match window, so it can't be used to
           dodge a bet mid-play. By the time it's callable, the sources show
           either a full-time score or an explicit postponement.
        3. Each source is classified INDEPENDENTLY ("postponed" / "finished" /
           "unknown", plus "unavailable" for a missing secondary) and the two
           statuses are cross-checked ON-CHAIN, after consensus under
           gl.eq_principle.strict_eq:
             - If EITHER source shows a FINISHED result -> REVERT. This rejects
               both a plainly finished match AND a conflict (one source says
               postponed, the other finished): a decided match can never be
               turned into a refund.
             - The PRIMARY (authoritative) source must itself say postponed.
             - The SECONDARY must AGREE (also postponed). If the secondary is
               unavailable, fall back to primary-only ONLY when the primary is
               EXPLICIT (contains a postponed / called-off / cancelled /
               suspended / abandoned word); otherwise stay OPEN. Any other
               combination (e.g. secondary "unknown") stays OPEN.
           A suspended / abandoned / called-off fixture with NO full-time score
           is treated as postponed; a match that kicked off is only postponable
           if a source EXPLICITLY says it was abandoned / not completed.

        On confirmation, status -> REFUNDING and every staker can reclaim their
        OWN stake 1:1 via refund(). Nobody — caller included — can be paid a
        result this way; the only reachable outcome is a universal 1:1 refund.

You are checking whether a scheduled La Liga fixture was POSTPONED (also

Fixture:
  Home team: {team1}
  Away team: {team2}

Teams may appear under common abbreviations, English or Spanish spellings —
match by CLUB IDENTITY, not exact spelling. Examples: "Atletico"/"Atlético

PRIMARY source (BBC), authoritative:
{primary}
End of PRIMARY.

SECONDARY source (ESPN), independent cross-check (may be empty):

End of SECONDARY.

Classify EACH source INDEPENDENTLY. For a given source, the status is:
- "postponed": that source EXPLICITLY marks THIS fixture as postponed, called
  off, cancelled, suspended, or abandoned, AND shows NO full-time score for it.
  A match that started but was then abandoned / not completed counts as
  "postponed" ONLY if the source explicitly says it was abandoned or not
  completed (no full-time score).
- "finished": that source shows a FULL-TIME / final score for this fixture
  (the match was played to completion).
- "unknown": you cannot clearly tell from that source — the fixture is absent,
  merely scheduled/upcoming, in progress, or lacks explicit wording. Absence of
  a score, or of the fixture, is "unknown", NOT "postponed".

Rules:
- Judge the PRIMARY only from the PRIMARY text, and the SECONDARY only from the
  SECONDARY text. Do NOT let one source's wording decide the other's status.
- If the SECONDARY text is empty/blank, set "secondary_status" to "unavailable".
- Be conservative: only say "postponed" when the wording is EXPLICIT. When in
  doubt, use "unknown".

  postponed / called-off / cancelled / suspended / abandoned wording for this
  fixture (not merely a missing score).
