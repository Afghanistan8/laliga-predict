    La Liga '27 Predict — "AI Call".

    A read-only companion to the per-match pari-mutuel markets. Holds NO
    funds, has no pools, and never pays out — so its blast radius is zero.

    For each fixture, GenLayer's validators reach consensus on a single
    predicted outcome — home / draw / away — before kickoff, and store it
    on-chain so the frontend can show GenLayer's own call next to the crowd's
    pari-mutuel pools.

    One deployed instance holds predictions for every fixture, keyed by the
    SAME match_id the markets use, so the two line up on the frontend.

    Consensus via the NON-COMPARATIVE equivalence principle
    (gl.eq_principle.prompt_non_comparative): the leader scrapes the live
    standings and asks the LLM for a pick; every other validator only *judges*
    the leader's answer against a fixed set of criteria, without re-scraping
    BBC and re-running the LLM themselves. That is far lighter on Bradbury's
    thin validator set than the comparative principle (which forces every
    validator to independently re-forecast the match) — and a prediction is a
    judgement, so "is this a defensible pick?" is the right question to reach
    consensus on, not "did ten validators independently guess the same coin
    flip?".
